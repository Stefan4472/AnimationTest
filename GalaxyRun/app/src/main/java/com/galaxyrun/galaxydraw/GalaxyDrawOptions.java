/**
 * Defines the parameters to use when generating a "galaxy" image.
 *
 * Together, `startColor` and `endColor` are used to draw a color gradient
 * across the image, from left to right.
 *
 * Then a number of stars is generated according to `starDensity`.
 * These stars will have the `starColor` and `starRadiusPx` specified.
 * However, to create interesting variation, `sizeVariance` and
 * `brightnessVariance` can be set between 0 and 1 to specify how much
 * to randomly vary the size and brightness, respectively. Here, "variance"
 * doesn't have the same meaning as variance in statistics--instead, it is
 * a fractional value in the range [0, 1], where 0 = no variance,
 * and 1 allows for up to 100% variance from the set value.
 *
 * For example, if starRadiusPx=100 and sizeVariance=0.4, stars will
 * be generated with size uniformly distributed between [60, 140]. The
 * same concept applies to brightnessVariance, which varies the alpha
 * of the starColor.

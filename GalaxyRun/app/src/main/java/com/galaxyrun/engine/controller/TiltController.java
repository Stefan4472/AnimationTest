/**
 * Takes a real-time stream of gyroscope SensorEvents and turns them into control inputs for the
 * spaceship.
 *
 * Gyroscope events should be given to the TiltController in real-time using
 * `inputGyroscopeEvent()`. Then, call `calculateState()` at any time to calculate and return the
 * current control input.
 *
 * TiltController calculates the control state using the y-axis angular velocity reported by the
 * gyroscope, which reports the speed at which the phone is being tilted. It calculates a rolling
 * average on a small number of the most recent samples in order to reduce possible noise in the
 * gyroscope readings.
 *
 * The model for calculating control input works as follows:
 * - Calculate the average y-velocity of the most recent `MAX_NUM_SAMPLES` samples, ignoring any
 * that are older than `MAX_SAMPLE_AGE`. Let this value be `AvgY`.
 * - Cap AvgY such that its magnitude is less than or equal to `MAX_MAGNITUDE`.
 * - Normalize AvgY with respect to `MAX_MAGNITUDE`. If this value is less than
 * `NOISE_THRESHOLD`, consider the phone to be stationary.
 * - Determine the control input based on the sign of AvgY. A positive value means the device is
 * being tilted away from the user, resulting in an `UP` input; a negative value means the reverse.
 *
 * Overall, it is a simplistic model, but it seems to work fairly well.
 * TODO: account for screen rotations, which will flip the direction input.

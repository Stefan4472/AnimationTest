/**
 * Manages the state of the game.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Register yourself as an `IGameStateReceiver` to receive callbacks when the state changes.
 * - Call startGame() to move out of WAITING and into STARTING. This is the only way to leave the
 *     WAITING state.
 * - Call updateState() at the beginning of each game update. GameStateMachine will recalculate
 *     the current state and call the appropriate callback if the state has changed.
 * - Call getCurrState() at any time to get the most-recently calculated state.

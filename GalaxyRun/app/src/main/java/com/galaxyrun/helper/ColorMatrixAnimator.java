/*
Class used to animate a ColorMatrix. Currently the only supported animation
is a flash, where every pixel's Red/Green/Blue values are briefly jacked up
to 255 before coming back down to what they originally were.
The ColorMatrix uses a 20-element float[], visualized as a 4x5 matrix.
The 5th column of each row tells by how much to increase each
Red/Green/Blue/Alpha value. So, to transition to full white, we want to change
elems 4, 9, and 14 to 255, before bringing them back down to zero.
